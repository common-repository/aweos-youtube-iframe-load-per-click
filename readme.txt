This Plugin prevents the auto loading from YouTube iframes. It will be loaded after the user permits it.

== Description ==

### Prevent the Youtube iframe from loading automatically

This plugin prevents the automatic load of any YouTube iframe.
At the point where the YouTube video should be shown, a placeholder is loaded. It should open a connection to YouTube when a visitor clicks on the placeholder.
Thus, at best, blocks communication to the Google servers before the user explicitly wishes to do so (by clicking on the placeholder and loading it).

#### Beautifully swap Youtube iframes with a placeholder

* Block the iframe-loading without generating ugly gaps.
* Fully customizable CSS Classes for the placeholder.
* No setup required, no changes on your Youtube iframes.
* No branding necessary, no links to other websites.

#### Are your visitors protected?

* Informed the user that a connection to Google/YouTube is being established.
* Youtube videos can be blocked by the visitor. This can prevent the communication with a Google Server.

#### Bug reports and feedback

Your feedback is important, if you find bugs or have suggestions write us an E-Mail support@aweos.de
